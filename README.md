# What this program do?
I was learning OOP on python and managed to build this program. 

The program predicts the expected returns on investing in the SGBS. It predicts the price movement as per the historical CAGR value of Gold in past 5 years.
A user can change the value of CAGR. In the examples I have taken the value 9.2%.

The syntax for the code is:
> test = SoverignGoldBond(ISSUE_PRICE, UNITS, CAGR, YEAR).
